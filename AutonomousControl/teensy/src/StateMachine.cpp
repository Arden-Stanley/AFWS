/* PID Description:
  A PID (Proportion, Integral, Derivative) is a closed loop (feedback) system.
  Essentially, it takes error over time and uses it as a way to send power to the wheels when needed.
  We use this for wall-following.
  Formula = u(t) = Kp*e(t) + Ki*integral(e(tau)dtau) + Kd*de(t)/dt

  Here, sideDifference is the absolute value of the right subtracted by the left.
  We want to keep it at 0, which means that both sides are even, which is what 'desiredState' is.
